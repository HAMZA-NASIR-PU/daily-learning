## Spring Security
- org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept has AuthorizationFilter class:
```java
public class AuthorizationFilter extends GenericFilterBean{}
```

## Accessing elements in DOM using vanilla javascript
- document.querySelectorAll('.step') will return a `NodeList` which is an array of all html elements that has class `step`.

## Animation in CSS
- `animation-fill-mode` and `transition` in CSS

## Flexbox task in CSS
- You are given a container using a CSS flexbox layout that has four items (A1, A2, A3, and A4). By default, all items are placed at the end of the flexbox. Your task is to adjust the CSS in such a way that the first item A1 is aligned to the left end of the flexbox, while the other items (A2, A3, and A4) remain aligned to the right end.

```html
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:end;background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
  <div>A1</div>
  <div style="margin-left:auto">A2</div>
  <div>A3</div>
  <div>A4</div>
</div>
```

## Bridge Adapter in Virtualbox

A `bridge adapter` in VirtualBox refers to a network configuration that directly connects a `virtual machine's` network adapter to the `host computer's` physical network adapter, essentially allowing the virtual machine to act like a separate physical device on the same network, receiving an IP address from the same DHCP server as other devices on the local network; essentially making the virtual machine appear as a "real" device on the network. 


## Referential Equality in React

Referential equality refers to whether two variables reference the exact same object or array in memory. In JavaScript (and React), objects and arrays are compared by reference, not by their content. This behavior directly impacts React's rendering process, as it determines if components should re-render based on changes in props or state.

Two objects or arrays are considered referentially equal if they point to the same memory location. If a new object or array is created (even with identical content), it is not referentially equal to the previous one.

React uses referential equality to decide if a component should re-render:

- If a parent passes a new object or array to a child (even if it looks the same), the child re-renders because React sees the prop as "different."
- This is why memoizing objects/arrays or their derived values with hooks like useMemo is critical for optimization.

### Without Referential Equality

```javascript
function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  // New object created on every render
  const settings = { theme: "dark" };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent settings={settings} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ settings }) {
  console.log("ChildComponent Rendered");
  return <p>Theme: {settings.theme}</p>;
}
```

Every time the parent re-renders, the settings object is recreated, so ChildComponent re-renders—even though the settings content hasn't changed.

In the code example, `ChildComponent` re-renders because the settings object is being re-created on every render of `ParentComponent`. This happens even though the content of settings (i.e., { theme: "dark" }) does not change.

#### New Object on Every Render
In JavaScript, objects are compared by reference, not by value. When ParentComponent renders, the settings object is re-created as a new object in memory every time, even if its contents are the same. This causes React to detect a new prop for ChildComponent, triggering its re-render.

#### React's Behavior
React does a shallow comparison of props when deciding whether to re-render a child component. Since the reference to the settings object has changed, React assumes the prop has changed, and thus ChildComponent re-renders.

### Fixing with Referential Equality

To prevent ChildComponent from re-rendering unnecessarily, you can use the useMemo hook to memoize the settings object:

```javascript
function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  // Memoize the settings object
  const settings = React.useMemo(() => ({ theme: "dark" }), []);

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent settings={settings} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
#### Alternate Solution

You can also use React.memo to prevent ChildComponent from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed:

```javascript
const ChildComponent = React.memo(function ChildComponent({ settings }) {
  console.log("ChildComponent Rendered");
  return <p>Theme: {settings.theme}</p>;
});
```

This approach works because `React.memo` wraps the component and ensures it only re-renders if its props have changed. However, without `useMemo`, `React.memo` would still detect a change in settings due to the new object reference.

### Where Referential Equality Matters
- Props: Passing new object/array references causes children to re-render.
- Context: Context value updates trigger re-renders in all consumers unless memoized.
- Dependencies in Hooks: Incorrectly referencing objects/arrays in dependency arrays can lead to unintended effects.

### Key Points
- Primitives (e.g., strings, numbers): Compared by value. No issue with referential equality.
- Objects/Arrays: Compared by reference. Can trigger unnecessary re-renders if not memoized.
- Use tools like React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to maintain referential equality and


## Subsequent-sibling combinator

The subsequent-sibling combinator (~, a tilde) separates two selectors and matches all instances of the second element that follow the first element (not necessarily immediately) and share the same parent element.

In the following example, the subsequent-sibling combinator (~) helps to select and style paragraphs that are both siblings of an image and appear after any image.

```css
img ~ p {
  color: red;
}
```

## ConcurrentHashMap in Java

The ConcurrentHashMap class is introduced in JDK 1.5 belongs to java.util.concurrent package, which implements ConcurrentMap as well as to Serializable interface also. ConcurrentHashMap is an enhancement of HashMap as we know that while dealing with Threads in our application HashMap is not a good choice because performance-wise HashMap is not up to the mark.

ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface in Java, which means multiple threads can access it simultaneously without any synchronization issues. It’s part of the java.util.concurrent package and was introduced in Java 5 as a scalable alternative to the traditional HashMap class.

One of the key features of the ConcurrentHashMap is that it provides fine-grained locking, meaning that it locks only the portion of the map being modified, rather than the entire map. This makes it highly scalable and efficient for concurrent operations. Additionally, the ConcurrentHashMap provides various methods for atomic operations such as putIfAbsent(), replace(), and remove().
