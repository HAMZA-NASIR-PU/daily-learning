- You are given a container using a CSS flexbox layout that has four items (A1, A2, A3, and A4). By default, all items are placed at the end of the flexbox. Your task is to adjust the CSS in such a way that the first item A1 is aligned to the left end of the flexbox, while the other items (A2, A3, and A4) remain aligned to the right end.

```html
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:end;background-color:lightgray;width:100%">
  <div>A1</div>
  <div style="margin-left:auto">A2</div>
  <div>A3</div>
  <div>A4</div>
</div>
```
